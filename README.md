# MyEditor
This is my Editor.

I tried creating my own little text/code Editor a while ago (9 Months) and this is the Outcome of it.

It has Code highlighting and was meant to be for coding, even though you can also edit normal text with no probem.

Its not finished by any means but it works.

It still has quite a few bugs and the Source code is ass because it was one of my first Projects.

I didnt wont to just through it away and forget about it, so here you go.

# Controlls:
* str + "o" = open a new File.
* str + "s" = save File.
* NumPad_add = Font size bigger.
* NumPad_sub = Font size smaller.
* str + "v" = Paste.
* str + "a" = Mark all. (only usfull if you want to delete everything becuase you cant copy)
* str + "c" = does Nothing.
